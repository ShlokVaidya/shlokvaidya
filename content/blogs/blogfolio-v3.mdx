# Building Blogfolio v3: A Modern Portfolio & Blog Platform

Welcome to the third iteration of my portfolio website! After multiple iterations and learning experiences, I've built a comprehensive platform that combines a blog, portfolio, and various integrations to showcase my work and development journey. This post will take you through the technical architecture, features, and design decisions that power this website.

## Tech Stack Overview

The foundation of Blogfolio v3 is built on modern, performant technologies:

- **Framework:** Next.js 16.0 with App Router (latest)
- **UI Library:** React 19.1 (cutting-edge)
- **Language:** TypeScript 5 for type safety across the entire codebase
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4.1 with custom design system
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Vercel Postgres)
- **Content:** MDX for rich, interactive blog posts
- **Deployment:** Vercel with Edge Functions
- **Analytics:** Vercel Analytics & Speed Insights
- **Build Tool:** Turbopack for lightning-fast development

## Frontend Architecture

### UI Components & Design System

The frontend is built with a component-driven approach using shadcn/ui as the base component library. I've customized and extended these components to create a unique visual identity:

**Key UI Features:**
- **Floating Navigation Bar:** A modern, glassmorphic navbar that follows you as you scroll
- **Spotlight Effect:** Interactive spotlight animations using Framer Motion
- **3D Globe:** Powered by Cobe for an eye-catching visual element
- **Dark Mode Support:** Seamless theme switching with next-themes
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach ensuring great UX on all devices

### Dynamic Content Rendering

The blog system leverages MDX (Markdown + JSX) for content creation, allowing me to embed React components directly in blog posts. This enables:

- Interactive code examples
- Custom callouts and alerts
- Embedded media and widgets
- Dynamic data visualization

```typescript
// Reading time calculation for each post
import readingTime from 'reading-time';
import matter from 'gray-matter';

const stats = readingTime(content);
const metadata = matter(content);
```

### Features Section

The homepage features section showcases live data from various APIs:

#### **1. Hackatime (WakaTime) Integration**
Real-time coding statistics displaying:
- Total coding time (last 7 days)
- Daily average
- Top programming languages with percentage breakdown
- Animated progress bars

#### **2. Spotify Now Playing**
Live music status showing:
- Currently playing track
- Artist and album information
- Album artwork
- Direct link to Spotify

#### **3. GitHub Activity**
Recent repository activity and contribution stats

## Backend Infrastructure

### API Routes

The backend is powered by Next.js API routes (Route Handlers) organized by functionality:

```
/api
├── admin/          # Admin authentication & management
├── cloudinary/     # Image optimization & delivery
├── contact/        # Contact form submissions
├── emails/         # Email service integration
├── github/         # GitHub API integration
├── hackatime/      # WakaTime/Hackatime stats
├── rss/            # RSS feed generation
├── spotify/        # Spotify Now Playing API
├── status/         # Real-time status updates
├── subscribe/      # Newsletter subscriptions
└── views/          # Page view tracking
```

### Database Design

PostgreSQL handles all persistent data with efficient schema design:

**Key Tables:**
- **Views:** Page view tracking with IP-based deduplication
- **Sessions:** Admin authentication sessions with JWT
- **Subscribers:** Email newsletter management
- **Status Updates:** Real-time status posting system

```typescript
// Database connection with connection pooling
import { Pool } from "pg";

export const db = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_URL,
  max: 20,
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 5000,
});

// Graceful error handling for production
db.on("error", (err) => {
  console.warn("Unexpected error on idle client", err);
});
```

### Authentication System

A custom-built admin authentication system using:
- **OTP-based login:** Email-based one-time passwords for secure access
- **JWT tokens:** Secure session management
- **HTTP-only cookies:** Protection against XSS attacks
- **Session cleanup:** Automatic expiration of old sessions

```typescript
// Secure OTP generation and verification
import crypto from 'crypto';

const otp = crypto.randomInt(100000, 999999).toString();
// Stored with bcrypt hashing for security
```

## Advanced Features

**1. View Counter System**

Each blog post and page tracks views with intelligent deduplication:
- IP-based tracking to prevent duplicate counts
- Real-time updates using SWR
- Persistent storage in PostgreSQL
- Animated counter display

**2. Contact Form with Email Integration**

Nodemailer integration for handling contact submissions:
- Form validation
- Spam protection
- Email notifications
- Success/error toast notifications using Sonner

**3. RSS Feed Generation**

- Automatic updates on new posts
- Compatible with all RSS readers

**4. Image Optimization**

Cloudinary integration for media management:
- Automatic image optimization

- Schema.org structured data
- Open Graph & Twitter Card meta tags
- Reading time calculation
- Optimized Core Web Vitals

```typescript
// Dynamic sitemap generation
export async function sitemap() {
  const blogs = await getAllBlogPosts();
  
  return [
    { url: 'https://shlokvaidya.vercel.app', priority: 1 },
    ...blogs.map(post => ({
      url: `https://shlokvaidya.vercel.app/blog/${post.slug}`,
      lastModified: post.publishedAt,
    }))
  ];
}
```
