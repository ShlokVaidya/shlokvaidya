---

Welcome to my very first blog post! 🎉

I’m excited to share how I built this portfolio website you're browsing right now — and yes, I had some amazing help from **ChatGPT** along the way.

This project was more than just about putting my name on the web. It was a crash course in modern frontend development, SEO best practices, animations, and structured blogging — all while building something I'm truly proud of.

## 🚀 Tech Stack I Used

Here’s the stack I used to bring this project to life:

- **Next.js 15 App Router** (with `app/` directory)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **ShadCN UI** for clean, accessible components
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations
- **MDX** for blog content
- **PostgreSQL (Neon)** for storing blog/project metadata
- **Cloudinary** for media assets
- **SMTP via Testmail.app** for newsletter subscriptions

## 💡 Why ChatGPT?

I didn’t want to just copy a template and tweak colors. I wanted to **understand every line of code**, design a unique layout, and optimize performance + SEO.

That’s where ChatGPT stepped in — almost like a real-time senior developer + designer guiding me.

From planning components and folder structure to writing SQL queries and dynamic metadata — I built the entire site with ChatGPT as my pair programmer.

## ✨ Cool Features I Added

With ChatGPT’s help, I implemented some awesome features:

- 🌙 Dark mode support (with theme toggle)
- ⚡ Animated floating navbar
- 📚 Blog with search, tags, reading time, and live view count
- 💼 Projects page with featured projects and links
- 📨 Newsletter form with email notifications via SMTP
- 📈 Live RSS feed that auto-updates
- 🖼 Cloudinary image upload support for blog and project covers
- 🎯 SEO optimized: dynamic metadata, aria labels, and accessibility improvements

## 🔁 My Workflow

I used:

- **MDX files** to write blog content
- **Postman** to send metadata (slug, title, date) to my database
- **Cloudinary Upload API** for image management
- **SQL** with Neon DB to fetch/update views, subscribers, etc.

---

## 📬 What's Next?

I plan to:

- Publish deep-dive tutorials on web dev topics
- Share my personal projects and case studies
- Grow the newsletter community

If you’re a dev (beginner or advanced), I hope my journey inspires you to start building your own digital identity!
