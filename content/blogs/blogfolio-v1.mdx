# Building My Indigenous Blog System: Efficient Storage, Cloudinary Images, and Neon DB Integration

Creating a blogging platform that feels truly *mine* was a journey that involved some clever decisions around storage, image optimization, backend integration, and frontend design. In this post, I want to share how I approached building my own indigenous code for blogs, while keeping SEO intact and ensuring the system remains efficient and scalable.

## Local Storage of Blogs

One of the core philosophies behind my platform is to keep blog content stored **locally** in Markdown (`.mdx`) files. This approach provides simplicity and control. Each blog post is a self-contained file that can be version-controlled easily, enabling a seamless writing and editing workflow.

By leveraging MDX, I combine Markdown content with React components, which makes the posts highly flexible and interactive. Plus, since the blog content is static, it’s super fast to load and SEO-friendly by default.

## High-Quality Images via Cloudinary

To keep the site performance optimal without sacrificing image quality, I use **Cloudinary** to serve blog images. Instead of bundling images locally or hosting them on my own server, images are uploaded to Cloudinary and fetched dynamically.

This setup benefits SEO because:

- Images are optimized and delivered via a global CDN.
- I can transform images on the fly (resize, format conversion) for different devices.
- The blog’s static pages can reference images with clean URLs that improve loading speed and user experience.

## Tracking Views with Neon DB and Backend API

Counting how many times a blog post has been viewed is important for analytics and engagement. I use **Neon DB** as my backend database, with API routes that increment view counts each time a post loads.

Here’s the flow:

1. User visits a blog post.
2. Frontend calls an API route with the post slug.
3. API increments the view count in Neon DB asynchronously.

While this works well for views, I have noticed that **commenting and fetching comments** through the backend is currently slow. This is something I plan to optimize soon by refactoring the API endpoints and improving query efficiency.

## Clean, Uniform Components – With a Little Help from ChatGPT

Designing every single component of the blog—from the header, article layout, to the footer—was done with a focus on **cleanliness and uniformity**. Consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes make the blog visually pleasant and easy to read.

I also leveraged **ChatGPT** as a helpful assistant during the design and coding process. Whether it was brainstorming component structure or writing cleaner React hooks, ChatGPT’s suggestions helped speed up development without sacrificing quality.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Next.js & MDX:** For static generation of blog pages with embedded React components.
- **Cloudinary:** Image storage and delivery with powerful on-the-fly optimizations.
- **Neon DB:** Serverless Postgres database for tracking views and comments.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For quick, consistent styling.
- **ChatGPT:** My coding buddy for design ideas, troubleshooting, and clean code suggestions.
